    <h1>User Terms and Conditions of Service</h1>
    <h2>Updated as of June 1, 2021</h2>
    <p>
      Welcome to Gluck! We hope you’ll enjoy being a part of our community by participating in online gaming challenges,
      competitions and tournaments offered by Gluck (collectively, “Competitions”) and using other applications,
      tools and services offered by third-party developer partners. YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT YOUR ABILITY TO PARTICIPATE IN
      COMPETITIONS AND USE THE SERVICES OFFERED BY THIRD PARTY DEVELOPERS DOES NOT ESTABLISH GLUCK AS A PROVIDER OF
      COMPETITIONS OR THE SERVICES.
    </p>
    <p>
      BY REGISTERING FOR AN ACCOUNT WITH US (your “Account”), USING THE SERVICES IN ANY WAY, CLICKING “I ACCEPT” BELOW,
      DOWNLOADING ANY APPLICATION INTEGRATED WITH GLUCK (as further defined in Section 2.2 below, “Software”),
      OR REGISTERING FOR OR PARTICIPATING IN ANY COMPETITIONS, YOU: (A) ACKNOWLEDGE THAT YOU HAVE READ THESE TERMS AND
      CONDITIONS OF SERVICE AND ALL OBLIGATIONS AND RULES THAT MAY BE INCLUDED WITHIN EACH COMPETITION IN WHICH YOU
      PARTICIPATE (“Rules”) (these Terms and Conditions of Service, the terms of any policy incorporated herein,
      and the Rules are collectively referred to as the “Terms”) IN THEIR ENTIRETY; (B) AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THE TERMS;
      AND (C) ARE AUTHORIZED AND ABLE TO ACCEPT THESE TERMS. If you don’t wish to be bound by the Terms, do not click
      “I accept” and do not register with Gluck (“Gluck”, “we” or “us”) and do not use the Services. Declining to
      accept these Terms means you will be unable to participate in Competitions or use your Gluck account.
    </p>
    <h1>1. GENERAL TERMS</h1>
    <p>1.1. ARBITRATION. TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED UNDER APPLICABLE LAW, ANY CLAIM, DISPUTE OR CONTROVERSY OF
      WHATEVER NATURE (“CLAIM”) ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THESE TERMS AND/OR OUR SOFTWARE OR SERVICES MUST BE
      RESOLVED BY FINAL AND BINDING ARBITRATION IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE PROCESS DESCRIBED IN SECTION 14 BELOW. PLEASE
      READ SECTION 14 CAREFULLY. TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED UNDER APPLICABLE LAW, YOU ARE GIVING UP THE RIGHT TO
      LITIGATE (OR PARTICIPATE IN AS A PARTY OR CLASS MEMBER) ALL DISPUTES IN COURT BEFORE A JUDGE OR JURY.
    </p>
    <p>
      1.2. Changes to the Terms. We may amend, change, modify or revise the Terms at any time, and we may post a notice
      on our website at (“Website”) of any material changes, and you can see when these Terms were last revised by
      referring to the “Updated” legend above. Your continued participation in Competitions and/or use of Software or
      Services means you accept any new or modified Terms. You are responsible for reviewing the Terms for any changes,
      so please check back here from time to time.
    </p>
    <p>
      1.3. Eligibility. You may not modify these Terms except in writing signed by both you and Gluck. For purposes of
      these Terms, “writing” does not mean an email nor an electronic/facsimile signature.
    </p>
    <p>
      1.3.1. United States (U.S.). To be eligible to register an Account, to participate in any Competition or receive
      Services, and/or to download Software, you must: (a) be a natural person who is at least 18 years of age or older,
      and who is personally assigned to the email address submitted during your Account registration; (b) have the power
      to enter into a contract with Gluck; (c) be physically located within the U.S. when accessing your Account and
      participating in Competitions; (d) be physically located within a U.S. state in which participation in the
      Competition you select is unrestricted by that state’s laws; and (e) at all times abide by these Terms. If any one
      of these requirements is not met at any time, we, as agent for our developer partners, may suspend or close your
      Account with or without notice.
    </p>
    <p>
      1.3.2. Non-U.S. To be eligible to register an Account, to participate in any Competition or receive Services,
      and/or to download Software, you must: (a) be a natural person who is at least 18 years of age or older, and who
      is personally assigned to the email address submitted during your Account registration; (b) have the power to
      enter into a contract with Gluck; (c) be physically located in a jurisdiction in which participation in the
      Competition you select is permitted and unrestricted by that state or country’s laws; and (d) at all times abide
      by these Terms. If any one of these requirements is not met at any time, we, on behalf of our developer partners,
      may suspend or close your Account with or without notice.
    </p>
    <p>
      1.4. Registration. When you create an Account, you will be asked for a legitimate email address that you control
      and to create a password. After registration, you will be given the opportunity to create a username or accept a
      username given by the Services. The password and username are needed to participate in the Services. As a
      registered user, you can update your account settings, including your email address, by logging into your Gluck
      Account “Account Settings”. Also, if you forget either your password or username, you can visit the Website or
      email us for help. Please keep your username and password secret because you are responsible for all activity in
      your Account. Although we may offer a feature that allows you to “save” or “remember” your password, this feature
      makes it possible for third parties to access your Account, so please use that feature prudently because such use
      is at your own risk. We may, in our sole discretion, reject, change, suspend and/or terminate your username.
    </p>
    <p>
      1.5. Your Account. As the holder of your Account, you are solely responsible for complying with these Terms, and
      only you are entitled to all benefits accruing thereto. You may not allow any other person to (i) access your
      Account; (ii) access Services or Software through your Account; or (iii) accept or use prizes, winnings and other
      representative of value (including without limitation digital trophies, virtual currency or virtual goods)
      (collectively “Winnings”). Neither your Account nor Winnings nor any Digital Assets (defined in Section 10.3) are
      transferable to any other person or account. You must immediately notify us of any unauthorized use of your
      password or identification or any other breach or threatened breach of our security or the security of your
      Account in any Gluck-enabled game.
    </p>
    <p>
      1.6. Personal Location Data: As a part of this service, we collect location information from your device. If you
      would like to opt out of having this information collected, you can disable location access to any game with the
      Gluck Settings menu on your mobile device, tablet, or computer.
    </p>
    <p>
      1.7. Use of Information Collected: By upgrading an account and providing an email address, users authorize Gluck
      to provide them with important announcements, relevant promotions, and other related communications relating to
      the Service, Software and Competitions. Users will always have the opportunity to opt out of these communications
      at any time.
    </p>
    <p>
      1.8 Employee Policy: Gluck employees may use the Services and/or Software for the purpose of testing the user
      experience, but may not withdraw money. Gluck directors, contractors, affiliates, or partners may use the Website,
      Services and/or Software without such limitation, but only if they do not have any access to non-public
      information relating to the Services and/or Software that would lead to any advantage in their play using the
      Services and/or Software.
    </p>
    <h1>2. SERVICES AND SOFTWARE</h1>
    <p>
      2.1. The Services. On behalf of our developer partners, we may, with or without notice to you: (1) modify, suspend
      or terminate your access to the Website, Services and/or Software for any reason without liability; and (2)
      interrupt the operation of the Website, Services and/or Software as necessary to perform maintenance, error
      correction, or other work. As agent for our developer partners, we may suspend and/or close the account of any
      user who violates, or whom we reasonably believe may be in violation of or will violate, these Terms, at any time
      without notice and without liability. Also, and without limiting our other rights or remedies, if we believe you
      have violated these Terms or if you have violated these Terms, as agent for our developer partners, we may
      determine that your Winnings, if any, will be forfeited, disgorged or recouped.
    </p>
    <p>
      2.2. Remote Access and Updates. We and/or our developer partners choose to offer technical support for the
      platform from time to time in our discretion. Such technical support may require that we or our developer partners
      remotely access your device on which the platform is installed (“Device”). Also, if and when our developer
      partners update the Software or deploy patches, updates, and modifications to Gluck’s platform integrated into the
      Software, as applicable, we may do so through remote access of your Device without your knowledge. You hereby
      consent to these activities. You acknowledge that if we or our developer partners cannot remotely access your
      Device, then the Software may no longer work, and this may prevent you from participating in Competitions or
      otherwise receiving Services. We and/or our developer partners’ access to your Device will be limited solely to
      (i) providing support (ii) updating the Software or (iii) determining your location for skill-gaming regulatory
      purposes only, and is governed by the terms of our Privacy Policy.
    </p>
    <p>
      2.3. Beta Releases. For any Service that is identified by us or our developer partners as a “beta” version (“Beta
      Service”), you acknowledge and agree that a Beta Service may contain more or fewer features than the final release
      of the Service. We and our developer partners reserve rights not to release a final release of a Beta Service or
      to alter any such Beta Services’ features, specifications, capabilities, functions, licensing terms, release
      dates, general availability or other characteristics. Beta Services may not be suitable for production use and may
      contain errors affecting proper operation and functionality.
    </p>
    <p>
      2.4. Third Party Sites. You may be able to access third-party websites or services via the Software, Services or
      Website. We are not responsible for third-party websites, services, or content available through those third-party
      services. You are solely responsible for your dealings with third-parties (including advertisers and game
      developers). Your use of third-party software, websites or services may be subject to that third-party’s terms and
      conditions.
    </p>
    <h1>3. COMPLIANCE WITH LAWS</h1>
    <p>
      3.1. Prohibited US States/Countries. You acknowledge that various rules, regulations and laws addressing
      sweepstakes, contests, and tournaments with entry fees and/or prizes govern your participation in Competitions
      (“Gaming Laws”), and that Gaming Laws are set up by each individual US state, country, territory, or jurisdiction.
      Therefore, the Software DOES NOT permit Cash Competitions (as defined in section 8.3) to be offered to users
      participating in Competitions in any state in which such Competition violates its Gaming Laws (“Prohibited
      Jurisdiction”), and if you are located in any Prohibited Jurisdiction then you may not participate in Cash
      Competitions. In the United States, Prohibited Jurisdictions, as of the “Updated” date above, include: Arizona,
      Arkansas, Connecticut, Delaware, Louisiana, Montana, South Carolina, South Dakota, and Tennessee. It is your
      responsibility to determine whether the state, country, territory or jurisdiction in which you are located is a
      Prohibited Jurisdiction. Together with our developer partners, we reserve the right (but have no obligation) to
      monitor the location from which you access Services, and on behalf of our developer partners, we may block access
      from any Prohibited Jurisdiction. Each time you log in to participate in a Cash Competition, you must accurately
      confirm the location from which you are playing.
    </p>
    <p>
      3.2. Additional Laws. In addition to Gaming Laws, you are also subject to all municipal, state and federal laws,
      rules and regulations of the city, state and country in which you reside and from which you access and use
      Services, including without limitation U.S. export laws (together with Gaming Laws, the “Applicable Laws”). You
      are solely responsible for your compliance with all Applicable Laws. Access to Competitions may not be legal for
      some or all residents of, or persons present in, certain jurisdictions. SERVICES AND COMPETITIONS ARE VOID WHERE
      PROHIBITED OR RESTRICTED BY APPLICABLE LAWS. Your participation in Competitions is at your own risk, and you agree
      not to hold us responsible or liable if Applicable Laws restrict or prohibit your access or participation.
    </p>
    <p>
      3.3. LEGAL DISCLAIMERS. WE MAKE NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, AS TO THE LAWFULNESS OF YOUR
      PARTICIPATING IN ANY COMPETITION OFFERED BY OUR DEVELOPER PARTNERS OR USE OF SERVICES, NOR SHALL ANY PERSON
      AFFILIATED, OR CLAIMING AFFILIATION, WITH US HAVE AUTHORITY TO MAKE ANY SUCH REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES.
    </p>
    <h1>4. YOUR REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES TO US</h1>
    <p>
      You represent and warrant to us that (1) you have the right, authority, and capacity to agree to these Terms, to
      register for an Account, and to participate in those Competitions for which you register; and (2) you will comply
      with these Terms when participating in Competitions, receiving Services, and/or using Software; and (3) all
      information you supply to us or our developer partners is complete, accurate and current (and knowingly submitting
      incomplete or inaccurate information, or failing to update and maintain current, complete and accurate
      information, may result, without limitation, in immediate termination of your Account and forfeiture of Winnings).
    </p>
    <h1>5. YOUR INDEMNIFICATION OF US</h1>
    <p>
      You will, at your own cost and expense, indemnify and hold us and our directors, officers, employees and agents
      harmless from and against any and all claims, disputes, liabilities, judgments, settlements, actions, debts or
      rights of action, losses of whatever kind, and all costs and fees, including reasonable legal and attorneys’ fees,
      arising out of or relating to (i) your breach of these Terms; (ii) any use of your Account, the Website, the
      Software and the Services by any person including yourself; (iii) your violation of Applicable Laws; and/or (iv)
      your negligence or misconduct; and, if we instruct you in writing, you will, at your cost and expense, defend us
      from any of the foregoing using counsel reasonably acceptable to us.
    </p>
    <h1>6. PRIVACY</h1>
    <p>
      6.1. Privacy Policy. We are committed to your privacy, and our Privacy Policy, the terms of which are incorporated
      into these Terms as if set forth in their entirety, explains the policies put in place and used by us to protect
      your privacy as you visit the Website, participate in Competitions, download and use the Software and receive
      Services, and its terms are made a part of these Terms by this reference. We receive, store and use all
      information that you submit to the Website and all information you submit in registering for and participating in
      Services, in accordance with the Privacy Policy, so please read it carefully. We also collect anonymous aggregated
      and/or statistical data reflecting your use of the Website and Services and may use such data for tracking,
      reporting and other activities in connection with our business, also all in accordance with the Privacy Policy. We
      will not intentionally disclose any personally identifying information about you (including information submitted
      in creating an Account, your social security number, your email address, phone number, or passport, information
      obtained by the Website from cookies, and information regarding your IP address) to third parties without your
      consent except (1) where expressly specified in these Terms, (2) where expressly specified in the Privacy Policy,
      and/or (3) where we, in good faith, believe such disclosure is necessary to comply with Applicable Laws, to
      enforce these Terms against you, or to help prevent a loss of life or physical injury or crime.
    </p>
    <p>
      6.2. Communications with You. As also detailed in the Privacy Policy, we may use emails, text messages, and push
      notifications to notify you when you win our developer partners’ Competitions, when a Competition you have entered
      has completed, and to let you know of special promotions, events and policy changes. We may also communicate with
      you via email, text message, push notification or chat for any other purpose relating to Services or Software. We
      or our representatives may monitor all communications made by or received by you while using the Website and
      Services. If you do not wish to receive these communications from us, you may opt out by emailing
      info@GetGluck.com, but you acknowledge that opting out may result in your inability to participate in our
      developer partners’ Competitions or receive Services.
    </p>
    <p>
      6.3. Device Information. Using the Software and Services requires an Internet connection to our servers, and we
      (on behalf of our developer partners) or our developer partners may need to collect certain information from you
      and your Internet-enabled device (“Device”) in order to make the Software and Services available to you, such as
      hardware system profile data, internet connection data and any other data related to the operation of the Service
      from any Device that logs onto the Service using your Account. We will use this information in accordance with the
      Privacy Policy.
    </p>
    <p>
      6.4. Warning. Please take care in sending us sensitive information because third parties can unlawfully intercept
      or access transmissions or private communications between you and us, and you acknowledge that internet
      transmissions are never completely private or secure. For your safety, you should never reveal any sensitive
      personal information in any Gluck-enabled public forums, message boards or chat features.
    </p>
    <p>
      6.5. Promotional Activities. By registering for an Account, you allow us and/or our developer partners to publicly
      display your username and tournament records, and to use this information for any purpose. By using the Services,
      you allow us and our developer partners to print, publish, broadcast and use, worldwide, in any media and at any
      time, your name, picture, voice, likeness, and/or any biographical information that you submit to us or our
      developer partners (“Biographical Information”) for promotional, marketing or related business purposes, without
      compensation to you. However, we will never sell your Biographical Information without your prior written consent,
      and our use of your personally identifiable information is always governed by our Privacy Policy.
    </p>
    <p>
      6.6. Gameplay Dialogue. On behalf of our developer partners, we may use third party websites and technologies to
      record or stream gameplay or chat dialogue occurring through the Services, including your own dialogue
      (“Recordings”). We use Recordings to verify compliance with these Terms and as part of marketing and promotion of
      the Services. Please do not submit personally identifiable information in gameplay dialogue—this information is
      available for anyone to see and use. You may record and distribute your own recordings of gameplay dialogue for
      non-commercial purposes (i.e., you may not record or distribute Recordings for compensation) so long as your
      recording and distribution: (a) do not include other products or services that are competitive with the Services,
      and (b) comply with these Terms.
    </p>
    <p>
      6.7. Children. The Services will not knowingly accept personal information from anyone under 18 years old. If you
      believe that a child under 18 has gained access to the Services, please contact us at infor@GetGluck.com. On
      behalf of ourselves and our developer partners, we have taken commercially reasonable steps to restrict use of
      Services to those who are at least 18 years old. As agent for our developer partners, we do not sell products or

      disproportionately large load on network infrastructure, or that could damage, disable, overburden or impair our
      Websites or Services; (d) interfering with any other party’s use and enjoyment of Services and/or Software
      (including cheating) or the Website; and/or (e) attempting to gain unauthorized access to third party accounts,

    <h1>8. WINNINGS, ACCOUNT FUNDS, AND PAYMENTS</h1>
    <p>
      8.1. Fees. Fees and payments for Services that you pay to participate in Competitions (“Fees”) and billing
      procedures are detailed in the billing application. If Fees are charged to your Account, you agree to pay those
      Fees. All Fees are stated in U.S. Dollars, must be prepaid and are non-refundable. You are fully responsible and
      liable for all charges, deposits and withdrawals made under your Account, including any unauthorized charges,
      deposits or withdrawals. The price of Services may change at any time, but no price change will affect your past
      purchases.
    </p>
    <p>
      8.2. Billing. As agent for our developer partners, we may change Fees and billing procedures by updating the
      billing application with or without notice to you. By providing a payment method, you (i) represent that you are
      authorized to use the payment method that you provided and that any payment information you provide is true and
      accurate; (ii) authorize us, as agent for our developer partners, to charge you for the Services using your
      payment method; and (iii) authorize us, as agent for our developer partners, to charge you for any paid feature
      of the Services that you choose to sign up for. As agent for our developer partners, we may bill you (a) in
      advance; (b) at the time of purchase; or (c) shortly after purchase, in our sole discretion. You must tell us
      within 120 days after an error first appears on your bill for an investigation of the charge to occur promptly.
      After 120 days from the first appearance of the error, neither we nor our developer partners (i) will be liable
      for any losses resulting from the error and (ii) will be required to correct the error or provide a refund. If
      we or our developer partners identifies a billing error, it will be corrected within 90 days. You must pay for
      all reasonable costs we, as agent for our developer partners, incur to collect any past due amounts, including
      without limitation reasonable attorneys’ fees and other legal fees and costs.
    </p>
    <p>
      without depositing U.S. Dollars into your Account for that Competition, then you are a “Non-Cash Player” with
      respect to such Competition. However, if you play in a Competition that requires an entry paid in U.S. Dollars
      (“Cash Competition”), then you are a “Cash Player”, and if you establish a positive Account balance for entry
      fees for Cash Competitions, then you must submit and maintain at all times the following current and correct
      information: your full name, your permanent residential address, your phone number and your credit card or other
      payment information. Participating in Cash Competitions may require establishing a positive Account balance in
      any amount we or our developer partners determine. If you are a Cash Player, by submitting this information, you
      consent to allowing us and our developer partners to share your personal and payment information in confidence
      with third party service providers for the purposes of validating your identity and assessing the transaction
      risk associated with accepting your selected method of payment, and for any other purpose as detailed in our
      Privacy Policy. If you make a credit card deposit, an authorization request will be submitted to the issuing
      bank of at least Ten U.S. Dollars (US$10.00) to your credit limit, even if the actual amount charged may be
      lower. When you withdraw funds from your account, you may be required to submit your social security number or
      other identifying information. Failure to provide your social security number or other requested identifying
      information at that time may result in inability to process your withdrawal for any winnings.
    </p>
    <p>
      8.4. Bonus Funds. If you are a Cash Player then you may be granted bonus funds and/or credits (“Bonus Funds”).
      Bonus Funds can be used to enter Cash Competitions, but cannot be withdrawn or used for any other Service. When
      you enter a Cash Competition, US$0.01 (one U.S. cent) of Bonus Funds will be used to enter the competition for
      every US$0.10 (ten U.S. cents) spent on the Cash Competition entry fee. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
      additional Bonus Funds will be used to enter Cash Competitions if Bonus Funds are the only currency available in
      your account. When you win a Cash Competition, any Bonus Funds that you have used to pay the entry fee will be
      returned to you and any additional winnings beyond your entry fee will be paid in U.S. Dollars. If you initiate
      a withdrawal of funds from your Account, you will forfeit all Bonus Funds currently in your Account. If you do
      not enter a Cash Competition within a continuous 60 day time period, all Bonus Funds in your account will be
      forfeited.
    </p>
    <p>
      8.5. Withdrawals. If you are a Cash Player, you may request a withdrawal of funds from your available Account
      balance at any time. Digital Assets and Bonus Funds cannot be withdrawn. Processing of requested funds is made
      by bank transfer or by refund to the payment method used to make your deposit and may take up to ninety (90)
      days; provided, however, that we, as agent for our developer partners, may freeze your Account and/or delay a
      request for withdrawal of funds pending completion of any investigation of reported or suspected Abuse,
      verification of eligibility or to comply with Applicable Laws. A check request processing fee of up to $2.00 for
      any withdrawal of less than $10.00 may be assessed.
    </p>
    <p>
      8.6. Closing Accounts; Forfeiture of Funds. If you close your Account, funds in your Account will be returned
      subject to the terms of Section 8.5. If your Account is unilaterally closed or terminated for cause as allowed
      in these Terms, funds in your Account may be forfeited and not returned to you. If your funds are forfeited by
      you in accordance with this Section or Sections 2.1, 4, 7.3, 7.4, 7.5 or 8.9 hereof, these funds may be used to
      defray the costs of administration and enforcement of these Terms, allocated or disbursed such amounts to other
      Services or donated these funds.
    </p>
    <p>
      8.7. Account Monthly Maintenance Fee. If your Account is inactive (i.e. you have not entered at least one (1)
      tournament) for six (6) consecutive months or more, a maintenance fee of $2.00 per month may be charged (the
      “Monthly Maintenance Fee”). After five or more months of inactivity you will be notified by email that if your
      Account remains inactive for one more month, the Monthly Maintenance Fee will be deducted from your Account each
      consecutive month after that that it remains inactive. The Monthly Maintenance Fee will not be deducted from
      your Account if there are no funds in your Account. However, if your Account has no funds and has been inactive
      for twelve or more consecutive months, your Account may be closed.
    </p>
    <p>
      8.8. Refund Policy. Unless otherwise required by law, no refunds are given.
    </p>
    <p>
      our developer partners, we may require that you provide proof that you are, or were at the time of your
      participation in the subject Competition, eligible to participate in accordance with these Terms and that your
      participation was in accordance with these Terms. If you do not provide such proof to our or our developer
      partners’ reasonable satisfaction, then you will not receive the relevant Winnings. If you receive a payment in
      error, we, as agent for our developer partners, may reverse or require return of the payment. You agree to
      cooperate with our efforts to do this, in our capacity as agent for our developer partners. We may also reduce
      payment to you without notice to adjust for any previous overpayment.
    </p>
    <p>
      8.10. Credit Card/PayPal Use. When you pay for any charges by credit card, you represent to us that you are the
      authorized user of such credit card. You must promptly notify us of any changes to your credit card account
      number, its expiration date and/or your billing address, or if your credit card expires or is canceled for any
      reason. We are not liable for any loss caused by any unauthorized use of your credit card or other method of
      payment by a third party (such as PayPal) in connection with the Services. Any attempt to defraud through the
      use of credit cards or other methods of payment, regardless of the outcome, or any failure by you to honor
      legitimate charges or requests for payment, will result in immediate termination of your Account, forfeiture of
      Winnings, and pursuit of civil litigation and/or criminal prosecution.
    </p>
    <p>
      8.11. Taxes. If you are a U.S. resident, we, as agent for our developer partners, may send you an IRS Form W-9
      and 1099-MISC or other appropriate form if your Winnings total $600 or more in any given calendar year.
      Depending on the state in which you reside, we may also send you additional federal or state tax forms. Without
      limiting the foregoing, as agent for our developer partners, we may withhold from your existing Account balance
      and/or from future Winnings any amount required to be withheld by Applicable Laws, including amounts due in
      connection with your failure to complete relevant tax documentation, but you remain solely responsible for
      paying all federal, state and other taxes in accordance with all Applicable Laws.

    <h1>12. DISCLAIMERS</h1>
    <p>
      In conjunction with our developer partners, we strive to keep Services up and running; however, all online
      services suffer occasional disruptions and outages, and we are not responsible or liable for any disruption or
      loss you may suffer as a result. You should regularly backup content that you store on the Services.
      TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED UNDER APPLICABLE LAW, ALL SERVICES, PRODUCTS, INFORMATION AND DATA PROVIDED OR
      MADE AVAILABLE BY US OR OUR DEVELOPER PARTNERS (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION DIGITAL ASSETS AND SOFTWARE) ARE “AS
      IS” AND WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO, IMPLIED
      WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGEMENT, AND YOU ASSUME THE ENTIRE

    <h1>13. LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY</h1>
    <p>
      TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED UNDER APPLICABLE LAW, NEITHER WE, NOR OUR DEVELOPER PARTNERS, SUPPLIERS OR
      LICENSORS, WILL BE LIABLE TO YOU OR ANY THIRD PARTY FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, PUNITIVE, CONSEQUENTIAL (INCLUDING,
      WITHOUT LIMITATION, LOST PROFITS, LOST DATA OR LOSS OF GOODWILL) OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING
      TO THESE TERMS, THE WEBSITE OR ANY INFORMATION, SERVICES, PRODUCTS OR SOFTWARE MADE AVAILABLE OR ACCESSIBLE TO
      YOU, WHETHER BASED ON A CLAIM OR ACTION OF CONTRACT, WARRANTY, NEGLIGENCE, STRICT LIABILITY OR OTHER TORT, BREACH

      SUPPLIERS OR LICENSORS HAVE BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH LIABILITY.
      TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED UNDER APPLICABLE LAW, OUR MAXIMUM LIABILITY TO YOU ARISING OUT OF OR IN ANY WAY
      CONNECTED TO THESE TERMS SHALL NOT EXCEED U.S. $50.00. THE EXISTENCE OF ONE OR MORE CLAIMS BY YOU WILL NOT
      INCREASE OUR LIABILITY. IN NO EVENT SHALL OUR DEVELOPER PARTNERS, SUPPLIERS OR LICENSORS HAVE ANY LIABILITY
      ARISING OUT OF OR IN ANY WAY CONNECTED TO OUR PRODUCTS, INFORMATION OR SERVICES.
      Certain jurisdictions do not allow limitations of liability for incidental, consequential or certain other types
      of damages; as such, the limitations and exclusions set forth in this Section may not apply to you.
    </p>
    <h1>14. DISPUTE RESOLUTION AND ARBITRATION</h1>
    <p>
      14.1. General. This Section applies to any Dispute except for Disputes relating to the enforcement or validity of
      our intellectual property rights. The term “Dispute” means any dispute, action or other controversy between you
      and us concerning these Terms, the Services or any product, service or information we make available to you,
      whether in contract, warranty, tort, statute, regulation, ordinance or any other legal or equitable basis.
      “Dispute” will be given the broadest possible meaning allowable under law. In the event of a Dispute, you or we
      must give the other a Notice of Dispute, which is a written statement that sets forth the name, address and
      contact information of the party giving it, the facts giving rise to the Dispute, and the relief requested. You
      must send any Notice of Dispute by email to info@GetGluck.com. We will send any Notice of Dispute to you by U.S.
      Mail to your address if we have it, or otherwise to your email address. You and we will attempt to resolve any
      Dispute through informal negotiation within sixty (60) days from the date the Notice of Dispute is sent. After
      sixty (60) days, either you or we may commence arbitration. You may also litigate any Dispute in small claims
      court in your county of residence or Houston, Texas, if the Dispute meets all requirements to be heard in the
      small claims court. You may litigate in small claims court whether or not you negotiated informally first.
    </p>
    <p>

      14.2. Binding arbitration. If you and we do not resolve any Dispute by informal negotiation or in small claims
      court, any other effort to resolve the Dispute will be conducted exclusively by binding arbitration as described
      in this Section. Instead, all Disputes will be resolved before a neutral arbitrator, whose decision will be final
      except for a limited right of appeal under the Federal Arbitration Act. Any court with jurisdiction over the
      parties may enforce the arbitrator’s award.
    </p>
    <p>
      14.3. Class action waiver. To the maximum extent permitted under applicable law, any proceedings to resolve or
      litigate any Dispute in any forum will be conducted solely on an individual basis. Neither you nor we will seek to
      have any Dispute heard as a class action or in any other proceeding in which either party acts or proposes to act
      in a representative capacity. No arbitration or proceeding will be combined with another without the prior written
      consent of all parties to all affected arbitrations or proceedings. If this waiver is found to be illegal or
      unenforceable as to all or some parts of a Dispute, then it won’t apply to those parts. Instead, those parts will
      be severed and proceed in a court of law, with the remaining parts proceeding in arbitration.
    </p>
    <p>
      14.4. Arbitration procedure. If you are located within the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom or the
      European Union, or any of their territories, then any arbitration will be conducted by the American Arbitration
      Association (the “AAA”) under its Commercial Arbitration Rules. You and we each agree to commence arbitration only
      in Houston, Texas, USA. You may request a telephonic or in-person hearing by following the AAA rules. In a Dispute
      involving $10,000 or less, any hearing will be telephonic unless the arbitrator finds good cause to hold an
      in-person hearing instead. If you are located in a country other than listed above, then arbitration will be
      conducted by the International Court of Arbitration of the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC) pursuant to
      UNCITRAL rules, and the arbitration shall be conducted in English and the English version of these Terms (and not
      any translation) shall control, and both parties hereby agree to accord this arbitration agreement the broadest
      scope admissible under applicable Laws, and that it shall be interpreted in a non-restrictive manner. The
      arbitrator may award the same damages to you individually as a court could. The arbitrator may award declaratory
      or injunctive relief only to you individually, and only to the extent required to satisfy your individual claim.
      These Terms govern to the extent they conflict with the arbitrators’ commercial rules. The arbitrator may award
      compensatory damages, but shall NOT be authorized to award non-economic damages, such as for emotional distress,
      or pain and suffering or punitive or indirect, incidental or consequential damages. Each party shall bear its own
      attorneys’ fees, cost and disbursements arising out of the arbitration, and shall pay an equal share of the fees
      and costs of the arbitrator and AAA; however, the arbitrator may award to the prevailing party reimbursement of
      its reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs (including, for example, expert witness fees and travel expenses), and/or
      the fees and costs of the arbitrator. Within fifteen (15) calendar days after conclusion of the arbitration, the
      arbitrator shall issue a written award and a written statement of decision describing the material factual
      findings and conclusions on which the award is based, including the calculation of any damages awarded. Judgment
      on the award may be entered by any court of competent jurisdiction. The parties waive their right to commence any
      action or judicial proceeding in connection with a dispute hereunder, except for purposes of: (i) recognition
      and/or enforcement of the arbitration award or any other decision by the arbitral tribunal, (ii) obliging the
      other party to participate in the arbitration proceedings, (iii) requesting any type of conservative or interim
      measure in connection with the dispute prior to the constitution of the arbitral tribunal, (iv) requesting the
      appearance of witnesses and/or experts, and/or (v) requesting that any information and/or documentation discovery
      be complied with. By agreeing to this binding arbitration provision, you understand that you are waiving certain
      rights and protections which may otherwise be available if a claim or Dispute were determined by litigation in
      court, including, without limitation, the right to seek or obtain certain types of damages precluded by this
      arbitration provision, the right to a jury trial, certain rights of appeal, the right bring a claim as a class
      member in any purported class or representative proceeding, and the right to invoke formal rules of procedure and
      evidence.
    </p>
    <p>
      14.5. Claims or Disputes. Must be filed within one year. To the extent permitted by applicable law, any claim or
      Dispute under these Terms must be filed within one year from the date of the cause of action. If a claim or
      dispute isn’t filed within one year, it’s permanently barred.
    </p>
    <p>
      14.6. Equitable Relief. You agree that we would be irreparably damaged if these Terms were not specifically
      enforced. Therefore, in addition to any other remedy we may have at law, and notwithstanding our agreement to
      arbitrate Disputes, we are entitled without bond, other security, or proof of damages, to seek appropriate
      equitable remedies with respect to your violation of these Terms in any court of competent jurisdiction.

    <p>
      Nothing in this Agreement shall be deemed to create a partnership or joint venture between the parties and neither

      prior and contemporaneous understandings or agreements, written or oral, regarding such subject matter. This
      Agreement may be executed in counterparts, each of which will be considered an original, but all of which together
      will constitute the same instrument. All rights and remedies, whether conferred hereunder, or by any other
      instrument or law, unless otherwise expressly stated, will be cumulative and may be exercised singularly or
      concurrently. The failure of any party to enforce any of the provisions hereof will not be construed to be a
      waiver of the right of such party thereafter to enforce such provisions. If one or more provisions in this
      Agreement are ruled entirely or partly invalid or unenforceable by any court or governmental authority of
      competent jurisdiction, then the validity and enforceability of all provisions not ruled to be invalid or
      unenforceable shall remain unaffected. EVERY PROVISION OF THIS AGREEMENT WHICH PROVIDES LIMITATION OF LIABILITY,
      DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES OR EXCLUSION OF DAMAGES IS A FUNDAMENTAL PART OF THE BASIS OF THE BARGAIN HEREUNDER. IF
      ANY REMEDY HEREUNDER IS DETERMINED TO HAVE FAILED OF ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE, ALL LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY AND
      EXCLUSIONS OF DAMAGES SET FORTH HEREIN SHALL REMAIN IN EFFECT TO THE MAXIMUM ALLOWED BY APPLICABLE LAW.
